                    <p>My name is Regina Pilipchuk. I'm a student at Clark College working towards earning an
                        Associate's
                        Degree
                        in
                        Web Development. </p>

                    <p>With each class I take, the goals are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To expand my knowledge of the fundamental programming concepts</li>
                        <li>Increase my experience with programming by completing assigned projects</li>
                        <li>Build my portfolio and apply what I learn by doing personal projects as well as in-class
                            projects
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="col-12 content-2 mt-4">
                    <div class="question-header">Programming Experience</div>
                    <p>I would say that I am still a beginner when it comes to programming. Only recently have I felt
                        comfortable to
                        start working on projects on my own.</p>

                    <p>I have worked with the following languages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>C#</li>
                        <li>PHP</li>
                        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>As for favorites, I think each language showed me a different perspective to programming. Python
                        was my first programming language in which I learned the basic principles of programming. C#
                        introduced me to Software Development principles, and PHP has showed me how one can
                        programmatically interact with web pages as well as how to read in data from a database server.
